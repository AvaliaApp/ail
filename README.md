# Avalia Compiler (IL)
**Avalia Intermediate Language** is a sophisticated tool that allows apps or custom languages to easily create fully-featured Minecraft plugins by generating simple to use and understand AIL classes.

### Motivation
Avalia IL was created to create a powerful yet simple communication bridge between [Avalia Node Editor](https://www.avalia.app) and [JVM bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode), specifically targeted for Minecraft plugin generation.
Custom IL made solely for that purpose gives a lot of posibilities and makes the process of compiling Node schemas to Minecraft plugin artifacts way simpler and more feature-packed.

AIL was not made with human-readability with mind but ease of generation by 3rd party apps, yet it's suprisingly easy to read and understand by humans, too. AIL requires a decent knowledge about 
how JVM bytecode works though, as it's heavily inspired by it. 

### Future
Our long-term goal is to create a platform that can be used in all kinds of applications that require Minecraft plugin generation (i.e custom languages, node editors, web-based editors etc.) 

For this goal to happen, we need to create a stable, well-designed and well-documented instruction set for all kinds of often uses to make generating Minecraft plugins easier than ever.

### Full documentation and Tutorials
Currently, there's no available documentation as AIL Compiler is still in it's early stages. Stay tuned!
